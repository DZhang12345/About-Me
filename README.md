# About-Me

A little about Darrick Zhang...

I am currently a freshman at Duke University as a Gates Scholar. My interests are in biostatistics, oncology, and neuroscience. I am seeking opportunities in novel research and hope to eventually obtain an MD/PhD where I would practice medicine, care for the community, and teach/present findings to the next generation.
